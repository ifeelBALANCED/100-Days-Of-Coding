# Broken Keyboard

Help! My keyboard is broken, only a few keys work any more. If I tell you what keys work, can you tell me what words I can write?

(You should use the trusty **dictionary1.txt** file, located at _assets_ folder).

## Input

A string of letters representing the keys that work on the keyboard, example:

```text
abcd
```

```text
qwer
```

```text
hjklo
```

## Output

Your program should emit the longest valid English language word you can make for each keyboard configuration.

## Challenge Output

```text
longestWord("abcd") ➞ "abaca"
longestWord("edcf") ➞ "deeded"
longestWord("bnik") ➞ "bikini"
longestWord("poil") ➞ "lollipop"
longestWord("vybu") ➞ "bubby"
longestWord("subtoxymerhlac") ➞ "carboxymethylcelluloses"
```
