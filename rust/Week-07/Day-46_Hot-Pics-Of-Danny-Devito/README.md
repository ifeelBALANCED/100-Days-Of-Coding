# Hot Pics of Danny DeVito!

I'm trying to watch some lectures to study for my next exam but I keep getting distracted by meme compilations, vine compilations, anime, and more on my favorite video platform.

Your job is to help me create a function that takes a string and checks to see if it contains the following words or phrases:

- "anime"
- "meme"
- "vines"
- "roasts"
- "Danny DeVito"

## Output
- If it does, return "NO!". Otherwise, return "Safe watching!".

## Example
```text
preventDistractions("vines that butter my eggroll") ➞ "NO!"
preventDistractions("Hot pictures of Danny DeVito") ➞ "NO!"
preventDistractions("How to ace BC Calculus in 5 Easy Steps") ➞ "Safe watching!"
```
