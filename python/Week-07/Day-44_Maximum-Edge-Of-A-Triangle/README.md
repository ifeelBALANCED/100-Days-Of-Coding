# Maximum Edge of a Triangle

Create a function that finds the maximum range of a triangle's third edge, where the side lengths are all integers.

## Example
```text
nextEdge(8, 10) ➞ 17
nextEdge(5, 7) ➞ 11
nextEdge(9, 2) ➞ 10
```

## Constraints
- The side lengths of the triangle are positive integers.
