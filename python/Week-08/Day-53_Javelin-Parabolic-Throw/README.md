# Javelin Parabolic Throw

Write a function that takes initial speed (**v** in m/s) and throw angle (**a** in degrees) and returns the maximum height and maximum range reached by javelin as a string.

## Examples
```text
javelinThrow(36.7, 45) ➞ "Ymax=34m, Xmax=137m"

javelinThrow(51.3, 20) ➞ "Ymax=16m, Xmax=172m"

javelinThrow(100.1, 89) ➞ "Ymax=511m, Xmax=36m"
```

## Notes
- Javelin starts moving at h=0m.
- Gravitational acceleration is **g=9.81 m/s^2**.
- All results should be rounded to the nearest whole number.
