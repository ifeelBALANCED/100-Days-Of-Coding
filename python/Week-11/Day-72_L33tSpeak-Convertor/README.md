# L33tspeak Converter

L33tspeak - the act of speaking like a computer hacker (or hax0r) - was popularized in the late 1990s as a mechanism of abusing ASCII art and character mappings to confuse outsiders. It was a lot of fun. One popular comic strip in 2000 showed just how far the joke ran.

In **L33Tspeak** you substitute letters for their rough outlines in ASCII characters, e.g. symbols or numbers. You can have 1:1 mappings (like E -> 3) or 1:many mappings (like W -> `//). So then you wind up with words like this:

```text
BASIC => 6451C
ELEET => 3L337 (pronounced elite)
WOW => `//0`//
MOM => (V)0(V)
```

## Mappings

For this challenge we'll be using a subset of American Standard Leetspeak:

```text
A -> 4
B -> 6
E -> 3
I -> 1
M -> (V)
N -> (\)
O -> 0
S -> 5
T -> 7
V -> \/
W -> `//
```

Your **challenge**, should you choose to accept it, is to **translate to L33T**.

## Example

```text
storm -> 570R(V)
```
