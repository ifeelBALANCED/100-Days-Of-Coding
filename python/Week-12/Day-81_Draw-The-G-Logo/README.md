## Draw the “G” Logo

Write a program or function that takes in a positive integer N, and outputs an N×N pixel image of Google's "G" logo according to this\* construction:

<p align="left">
  <img src="../../../assets/google_logo.png" width=600 height=600 alt="google logo">
</p>

For example, if N is 200, a 200×200 pixel logo should be output, with correct dimensions and colors:

<p align="left">
  <img src="../../../assets/google_logo_2.png" width=200 height=200 alt="google logo">
</p>

- It should look accurate regardless of how large or small N is.

- Your code should not need to connect to the internet. For example, scaling an externally hosted svg is not allowed. (Scaling an svg encoded in your code would be fine though.)

- Anti-aliasing may be used or not. It's up to you.

- Notice that the horizontal bar of the "G" does not extend all the way to the right edge of the image. The circle curves normally inward on the right edge before it is cut off.
